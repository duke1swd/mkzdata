This directory contains code to test various implementations of digital filter algorithms.
This code is intended to run on a Linux box, not on the mkrzero.

Gen22 is a program that writes filter code in an unrolled loop.
That code will be run on the mkrzero, but it is also used in filtertest, to test it out.

There are minor optimizations that could be made to the output of gen22,
but I am trusting even a moderately smart compiler can make the optimizations.
