Assume we can hit 150,000 bytes/sec.
This is 16,666 samples/sec on each of 6 channels, if we pack them.
Or we could not pack them, in which case it is 12,500 per second.
If we downsample 4x, we get 14-bit resolution at 12.5K samples/second


If we measure across multiple buffers, it appears we can consistently get 140,000 bytes/second using 48 buffers of 512 bytes each
Minimum block overhead is 4 bytes per buffer. Assume 512-byte buffer
This gives us an 8-byte header and 56 sets of packed data
Do the math, we get 15312.08 samples/sec/channel, packed


Given that ADC speeds are quantized, I think that means we run 12.5K, no downsampling.
If we could build a fancy filter, we could run 50K at 4x downsampling, I suspect we lack CPU.

So, first attempt will be 12.5K, no downsampling, but yes packing
