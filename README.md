# mkzdata
Arduino code to use an MKRZERO as a data capture device and a valve sequencer.

For now this is a bunch of code for testing out ideas.
Eventually we want to use this code to control a small rocket engine and capture data from it.
Basic goals are high speed A/D capture to microSD card, while having enough CPU left over to run a sequencing state machine.
